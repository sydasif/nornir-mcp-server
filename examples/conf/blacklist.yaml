# Command Blacklist Reference
# ---------------------------
# This file shows the default denylist configuration for reference.
# The actual denylist is hardcoded in src/nornir_mcp/utils/security.py
# 
# To customize, you would need to modify the DENYLIST dict in security.py
# or implement your own validation logic.

# Exact commands that are blocked (case-insensitive):
# - reload
# - erase startup-config
# - write erase
# - delete flash:
# - format flash:

# Keywords that trigger blocking (matched as whole words):
# - erase
# - format
# - delete

# Patterns that are blocked:
# - ">" (redirection)
# - "<" (redirection)
# - ";" (command chaining)
# - "&&" (command chaining)
